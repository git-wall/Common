# Dynamic Data Lifecycle Flow

This document complements the SVG diagram by explaining the dynamic aspects of data flow, particularly for log handling and data lifecycle management.

## Data Flow Dynamics

### 1. Data Collection & Ingestion
- **Real-time logs**: Application logs are collected by Fluentd/Logstash agents and streamed to Kafka/Pulsar
- **Batch logs**: Periodic log files are processed by NiFi for ingestion
- **Event streams**: Real-time events flow through Kafka/Pulsar topics
- **IoT data**: Device telemetry is collected and sent to message brokers

### 2. Processing Layer Dynamics
- **Stream processing**: 
  - Flink processes real-time data with millisecond latency
  - Spark Streaming handles micro-batches (seconds)
  - Storm provides native streaming for critical paths
- **Batch processing**:
  - Spark processes larger datasets in batch mode
  - Tez optimizes DAG execution for complex transformations

### 3. Storage Layer Dynamics
- **Hot storage** (recent data, high query frequency):
  - Elasticsearch for logs requiring full-text search
  - ClickHouse for high-performance analytics queries
- **Warm storage** (older data, medium query frequency):
  - HDFS for distributed storage within the cluster
  - S3/MinIO for object storage with lower cost
- **Cold storage** (historical/expired data, low query frequency):
  - S3 Glacier or similar archival storage
  - Automated lifecycle policies move data between tiers

### 4. Data Format & Organization
- **Table formats**:
  - Hudi/Iceberg/Delta Lake provide ACID transactions and time travel
  - Support incremental processing and schema evolution
- **File formats**:
  - Parquet for columnar storage with efficient compression
  - ORC for optimized row columnar format with predicate pushdown

### 5. Analytics Layer Dynamics
- **Query engines**:
  - Trino/Presto for federated queries across storage systems
  - Druid for real-time analytics with sub-second queries
  - Dremio for data lake queries with semantic layer
- **Metadata management**:
  - Hive Metastore tracks table definitions and partitions
  - Manages schema evolution and discovery

### 6. Monitoring & Visualization
- **Observability**:
  - SkyWalking provides distributed tracing and APM
  - Graylog centralizes log management and analysis
- **Dashboards**:
  - Kibana visualizes Elasticsearch data
  - Grafana creates dashboards from multiple data sources

## Log Lifecycle Management

### Large Log Handling
1. **Buffering**: Kafka/Pulsar buffers large log volumes to prevent downstream system overload
2. **Sampling**: High-volume logs may be sampled for performance metrics
3. **Aggregation**: Similar log events are aggregated to reduce volume
4. **Compression**: Logs are compressed during storage transitions

### Log Expiration Process
1. **Retention policies** define how long data is kept in each storage tier
2. **Time-based partitioning** facilitates efficient data lifecycle management
3. **Automated processes** move data through storage tiers:
   - Hot tier: 1-7 days (Elasticsearch/ClickHouse)
   - Warm tier: 8-90 days (HDFS/S3)
   - Cold tier: 91+ days (S3 Glacier)
4. **Purging processes** remove data that exceeds maximum retention period

### Runtime Environment
The entire data pipeline can run on:
- Kubernetes clusters for containerized workloads
- Virtual machines for specific components
- Hybrid cloud environments spanning on-premises and cloud resources
- Serverless components for specific processing tasks

This dynamic flow ensures that data is processed efficiently and stored cost-effectively based on its age and access patterns.
