## Log Management Beyond Graylog's 7-Day Retention
For your scenario where you need to store logs beyond Graylog's 7-day retention period, here's a comprehensive solution:

### Long-term Storage Options (without AWS)
1. MinIO : An excellent S3-compatible object storage that can be self-hosted
2. Ceph : Distributed storage system with object, block, and file storage
3. HDFS : Hadoop Distributed File System for large-scale data storage
4. SeaweedFS : Simple and highly scalable distributed file system
### Archiving Process
You can configure Graylog to archive logs to your chosen storage system before they expire. This can be done through:

- Graylog's built-in archiving capabilities
- Using Apache NiFi to create data pipelines from Graylog to storage
### Query and Analysis Tools for Archived Logs
1. Elasticsearch : Can be used to index and search archived logs
2. ClickHouse : Column-oriented DBMS excellent for log analytics
3. Apache Druid : Real-time analytics database designed for fast slice-and-dice analytics
4. Trino/Presto : SQL query engine that can query data from various sources including object storage
### Complete Solution Architecture
1. Short-term (7 days) : Logs stored in Graylog for immediate analysis
2. Archiving : Use NiFi to move logs to MinIO (recommended for S3 compatibility without AWS)
3. Long-term storage : MinIO with appropriate retention policies
4. Query capability :
   - For occasional queries: Trino/Presto connecting directly to MinIO
   - For frequent analysis: Import relevant logs from MinIO to ClickHouse or Druid
### Implementation Considerations
- Store logs in a structured format like Parquet or ORC for efficient storage and querying
- Implement proper partitioning in your storage (by date, application, etc.)
- Consider using Delta Lake, Iceberg, or Hudi for managing your data lake of logs
- Set up automated lifecycle policies in MinIO to manage long-term retention costs
