### Context Object Pattern
- All class define context is flowed by the context object pattern.
- The context object pattern is a design pattern that encapsulates all the information needed to execute a method in a single object. 
- This pattern is useful for passing data between different parts of an application, 
especially when the data is complex or when there are many parameters to pass.
