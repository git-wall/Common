I'm having an issue with the email campaign feature:

everything looks correct, but emails are t being sent at the scheduled time. 

Please help identify and fix the bug by fg lowing these steps:

1. Add logging at key points in the code/test to help with debugging. 
2. Run/re-run the related test files and review the logs to identify the bug, You may update the logging or test files to better capture the issue. 
3. Update the test file to reflect the bug scenario.
4. Fix the code.
5. Run the test again to verify the fix, checking the logs frequently to confirm
6. If the test fails or the logs don't confirm the code keep continue updating the code and tests until it works.
7. Remove all temporary logging.
8. Run tests and lint one final time to confirm everything is working and clean.
