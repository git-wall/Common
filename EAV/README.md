# EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) Module

This module implements the Entity-Attribute-Value pattern, which allows for dynamic attributes to be added to entities without modifying the database schema.

## Overview

The EAV pattern consists of three main components:

1. **Entity**: Represents the object that can have dynamic attributes (e.g., Campaign, Product, Customer)
2. **Attribute**: Defines the properties that can be associated with entities (e.g., name, description, price)
3. **Value**: Stores the actual values for attributes of specific entity instances

## Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Add new attributes to entities without modifying the database schema
- **Extensibility**: Support for different data types and validation rules
- **Reusability**: The same EAV module can be used for multiple entity types
- **Searchability**: Efficient searching and filtering of entities based on attribute values

## Limitations

- **Performance**: EAV queries can be more complex and slower than direct table queries
- **Complexity**: The EAV pattern adds complexity to the data model and application code
- **Data Integrity**: It's harder to enforce data integrity constraints in an EAV model

## Best Practices

1. Use EAV only for attributes that are truly dynamic and vary between entity instances
2. Keep fixed attributes in the entity table for better performance
3. Use appropriate data types for attribute values to enable efficient searching and filtering
4. Cache frequently accessed attribute values to improve performance
5. Use transactions to ensure data consistency when updating multiple attribute values
